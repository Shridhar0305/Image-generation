This is an image generation website created using OpenAI's DALLE API which generates images based on text prompts. This API can also create image variations of a single image which is another feature of the project.

The project is made using React for frontend and NodeJS for backend. This project generates 10 images for a given text prompt which can be increased to as many images using a paid version of the API. The public codebase of the project doesn't include an API key due to security reasons (but it can be edited in the server.js file). More info about OpenAI API keys on `https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys`.
The project can be run by terminal commands of `npm run start:backend` to run the backend and `npm run start:frontend` to run the frontend.
Another feature of the project is generating image variations of a single image by uploading the image on the website.
